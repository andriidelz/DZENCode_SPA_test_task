[ ] make secrets
[ ] make deploy-infra
[ ] make build-images
[ ] make deploy-services
[ ] make migrate
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment

```bash
# Create admin user
[ ] ./deploy-aws.sh superuser
# OR
[ ] make superuser

# Check deployment status
[ ] ./deploy-aws.sh status
# OR
[ ] make status

# Run health checks
[ ] ./aws-health-check.sh
# OR
[ ] make health
```
